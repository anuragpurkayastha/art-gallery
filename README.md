# Art Gallery

## Introduction

An art gallery website that I created as part of a university assignment. The aim of the assignment was to apply my skills and knowledge in PHP to build and develop a website where users could add art pieces.

Art pieces are also displayed on the home page and other related pages using JavaScript.

Bootstrap 4 framework was also used for the appearance and layout of the website.
